# Flow - Csikszentmihalyi

Flow is "game - like" experience task. It must be **challenging** with **goal** and **immediate feedback**

There are many examples of flow happening in free time, work, family, nations. Mostly it's describing how things are, not really giving tips and tricks how to achieve such state which is a shame.

- very hard to read / overcomplicated book
- much better alternative is [Drive - D.Pink](drive.md)
